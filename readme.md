# SysDVR UVC
This is the UVC branch of SysDVR, it was an experiment for implementing a usb video class device for low latency streaming. In the end i decided to stop working on this as improving the usb protocol turned out to be a much easier way to achieve the same goal. This is here only for reference in case someone else wants to give it a try. A lot of development happened as a standalone homebrew [here](https://github.com/exelix11/Uvc_dev)
